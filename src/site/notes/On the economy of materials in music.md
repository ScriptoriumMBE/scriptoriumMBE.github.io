The economy of materials is a subject of great importance in the history of Western Music, though it hasn't been widely talked about in concrete, explicit terms.

The ear is naturally drawn to repetition, be it literal, symbolic or abstracted. Economy of materials implies in a necessary way some higher degree of repetition and *vice versa*. Thus, composers are naturally drawn to some economy of material. This is a purely phenomenological observation.

Pairing an absolute economy of materials to other æsthetic/stylistic preferences can soon becomes a task of notable technical difficulty. This is how the ability to produce a piece with notable economy of material became associated with the recognition of technical ability (very notable in cases like the pedagogical status of the Fugue, like in the *Prix de Rome*).

In Western Music, the Germanic tradition became somewhat tied with the economy of materials. This is specially exemplified in the great works of Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven and countless others. The æsthetic philosophy of Arnold Schönberg also valued economy of materials, and gave rise to the (extremely formalist) serial æsthetic (that culminates in the pathology of exhaustivity found in Boulez).

There is nothing ontological in a piece of music needing to be economical or materially "coherent" in any way. But, much like there is an expectation of a piece of music being, in some sense, a round form, a form that closes itself, there is an expectation of economy, of recognisability, of repetition. This corner has some Platonist undertones.

Famously, Debussy
>believed that Beethoven had terrifically profound things to say, but that he did not know how to say them, because he was imprisoned in a web of incessant restatement and of German aggressiveness.[^1]

The view implicit in the quote is the critique of the material, motivic economy of Beethoven was taking place of the economy of the semantic economy. This exemplifies one of the dividing principles of [[wip/The Germanic and Parisian æsthetic archetypes\|The Germanic and Parisian æsthetic archetypes]], the central *quid* of it being the explicit *versus* the implicit. Both might be thought of as archetypal poles, the Germanic bringing the truth through form and the Parisian protecting truth from form.

In the end, economy —much like teleology— is a stylistic/æsthetic choice.
